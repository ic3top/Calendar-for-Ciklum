# Meeting shedule
> A meeting calendar for a team with several members for one week planning.

## General info
To my mind it's a cool project for a pure JS. I learnt a lot creating it and it seems like my webpack config needs some improvements:)
This tiny project can have much more interesting features like dark-theme or drag-n-drop. Well, maybe I'll implement them soon...

Take a look at the [DEMO](https://ic3top.github.io/Calendar-for-Ciklum/dist/)
